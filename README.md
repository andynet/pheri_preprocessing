# Pheri preprocessing

This repository is the source code of bioinformatics pipeline, which creates files used in Pheri program.
We strongly recommend NOT to install this software on your server, as it is not needed for Pheri program and files created by this pipeline are already included in Pheri installation.
This repository is meant for people, which would like to go into the details of our work.

You can find Pheri repository [here](https://github.com/andynet/pheri).\
We recommend to install Pheri from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/andynet/pheri/).\
This pipeline is result of bachelor thesis, so you can find detailed description [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-oW36NoQzHxzWUl4DRQWubHGlYMKd57/view?usp=sharing).\
